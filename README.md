# 📱 SMS Spam Detection

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a robust SMS classification model that accurately detects spam messages based on their text content.

---

## 🗃 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository via Kaggle (`uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset`)
- **Format**: CSV file with two columns:
  - `label`: `ham` (not spam) or `spam`
  - `message`: The SMS content

---

## 🔍 Feature Flow

1. 📥 Load Dataset  
2. 🧹 Preprocess Text (clean labels, remove nulls, etc.)  
3. 🧪 Train-Test Split  
4. 🧠 Text Vectorization → TF-IDF  
5. 📊 Train Naive Bayes Classifier  
6. ✅ Evaluate Accuracy & Generate Confusion Matrix  
7. 📩 Predict on New SMS Input  
8. 🔍 Visualize Important Spam Keywords  

```

## ⚙️ Model & Tools

- Language: **Python**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- Algorithm: **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Vectorizer: **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or open `Spam SMS Detection.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells step-by-step.
3. A model will be trained and tested.
4. Optionally test with a custom SMS message.
5. Outputs include accuracy, classification report, and visualizations.

## 🧪 Example Test

**Message**:
```
"Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card. Click to claim now."
```

**Model Prediction**: ✅ `Spam`

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Model Accuracy**: ~95%
- Simple yet powerful model for real-world spam filtering.
